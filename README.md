# ArcusX

ArcusX is a descentralized web3 freelancing platform based on Chile

The decentralized Upwork for Latin America — lowering fees by 80% and unlocking global payments for millions of freelancers.
ArcusX connects global clients with LATAM talent, enabling fairer work, instant payments, and financial inclusion through Web3 rails. 

Problem

Freelancers in LATAM lose up to 30% of income to platforms and face delayed, unreliable cross-border payments.
Current solutions exclude the underbanked and limit access to global opportunities. (https://docs.arcusx.one/getting-started/quickstart/about-arcusx)

Solution

ArcusX is a blockchain-powered freelance marketplace with transparent smart contracts.
We reduce fees to ~2%, enable instant crypto-to-fiat settlement, and open borderless opportunities.

Business Model

Revenue comes from transaction fees, premium client tools, and future fintech services (wallet, escrow, credit).
Our incentives are aligned: we only win when freelancers earn more. (https://docs.arcusx.one/getting-started/publish-your-docs)

Market Opportunity

Global freelancing is projected to hit $455B by 2030, with LATAM as the fastest-growing region.
ArcusX is positioned as the first Web3-native freelancing platform focused on this market. 

Traction & Roadmap

Smart contracts are deployed; MVP platform is in development. (https://docs.arcusx.one/community/arcusx-roadmap)

We’ve built an engaged LATAM Web3 community and established early partnerships for testing and adoption.
